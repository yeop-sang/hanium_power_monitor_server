		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Docker Compose Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the docker-compose.yml and .env files into subtasks for each service (MQTT broker, MySQL, Flask backend, Vue.js frontend, AI/LLM module), including network/volume setup, environment variable management, and validation/testing steps.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves orchestrating multiple services with Docker Compose, requiring careful configuration of service dependencies, environment variables, volumes, and networking. While not algorithmically complex, it demands attention to detail and best practices for maintainability and security, especially for production readiness[1][2][3][5]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Configure MQTT Broker with Persistence",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for directory setup, configuration file creation, permissions, QoS and persistence tuning, logging, and broker testing with client tools.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up Mosquitto with persistence and QoS involves file system configuration, broker settings, and validation with test clients. The steps are clear but require careful execution to ensure reliability and message durability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up MySQL Database with Schema",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this task into subtasks for schema creation, user/permissions setup, MySQL configuration tuning, backup strategy, test data insertion, and performance benchmarking.",
			"reasoning": "Database schema design, configuration for durability, and backup planning are foundational and require precision. Testing and performance validation add to the complexity, especially for long-term data retention."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Flask Backend Application",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend development into subtasks for project scaffolding, requirements/Dockerfile setup, MQTT client implementation, database integration, API endpoint development, main app orchestration, unit testing, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers full backend development, including real-time MQTT integration, database operations, REST API design, and robust error handling. It requires multi-module coordination and thorough testing, making it one of the most complex tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Vue.js Frontend Application",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for project setup, Docker/nginx configuration, component development (dashboard, charts, ESG report), API integration, styling, testing, and responsive design validation.",
			"reasoning": "Building a modern frontend with multiple components, API integration, and responsive design involves significant effort in both development and testing, especially for data visualization and user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI/LLM Module for ESG Report Generation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI/LLM module into subtasks for project setup, requirements/Dockerfile, database access, carbon calculation, Claude API integration, report parsing, API endpoint, and module/unit testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves advanced data processing, external API integration, and report generation logic, requiring careful design, error handling, and validation of both data and AI outputs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate ESG Report Display in Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for ESGReport component development, view/router integration, API service updates, UI/UX testing, and styling for tables and report sections.",
			"reasoning": "While focused on UI integration, this task requires coordination between frontend components and backend APIs, as well as attention to data structure, error handling, and user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Visualization Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks for each visualization component (PowerChart, EnvironmentalChart, CurrentPowerDisplay), data fetching logic, chart configuration, responsive design, accessibility, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "Developing interactive, real-time data visualizations with multiple chart types and responsive layouts is moderately complex, requiring both frontend engineering and integration with backend data sources."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "System Integration and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for test plan creation, environment setup, automated test script development, end-to-end data flow validation, error/edge case testing, performance testing, health check scripting, documentation, deployment checklist, and user acceptance testing.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task, involving coordination of all system components, comprehensive testing (functional, performance, resilience), automation, documentation, and final deployment readiness. It requires a holistic understanding of the entire system and rigorous validation."
