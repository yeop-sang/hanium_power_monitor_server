# Product Requirements Document for Power Measurement Service Server Setup

## 1. Introduction

This product is a power consumption measurement service designed to help users monitor and analyze their electricity usage, along with environmental data. It addresses the problem of opaque energy consumption by collecting real-time sensor data (including temperature, humidity, brightness, and electric power), storing it, and presenting it through an intuitive web interface. Its value lies in empowering users to understand their energy patterns, identify potential savings, and gain insights from AI-driven analysis of their usage, specifically focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting for environmental aspects, including carbon emission calculations. 

**Multi-Device Support:** The system is designed to handle multiple measurement devices simultaneously, allowing users to monitor different rooms, buildings, or equipment zones independently while providing comparative analysis and consolidated reporting across all connected devices.

The primary users are individuals or small businesses seeking to optimize their energy consumption across multiple locations or zones. Data from measurement devices will be transmitted in a specific JSON format, with a timestamp indicating the device's measurement time, and an expected transmission frequency of every 5 seconds. The collected data will be preserved indefinitely in the MySQL database. Critical consideration will be given to ensuring no data loss, even if it means allowing some duplication or delayed real-time visibility during network outages.

**Measurement Data JSON Format Example:**
```json
{
    "deviceCode": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF", // MAC address for unique device identification
    "timestamp": "2023-06-27T14:30:00Z", // Device-generated timestamp
    "temp": 23.7,
    "humidity": 60.5,
    "brightness": 700,
    "electric": 900
}
```

## Core Features

### Real-time Data Collection
- **What it does:** Collects power consumption and environmental data (`deviceCode`, `timestamp`, `temp`, `humidity`, `brightness`, `electric`) from multiple Arduino/ESP32 modules, every 5 seconds, including the device's measurement timestamp.
- **Why it's important:** Provides immediate insights into current electricity usage and environmental conditions across multiple locations, while ensuring data integrity and accurate time correlation.
- **How it works:** Multiple ESP32 devices publish data in the specified JSON format via MQTT to the server, with mechanisms (e.g., QoS 1/2, persistent sessions) to minimize data loss.

### Multi-Device Management
- **What it does:** Manages multiple measurement devices simultaneously, allowing users to monitor, configure, and analyze data from different zones, rooms, or equipment.
- **Why it's important:** Enables comprehensive multi-location energy management, allowing users to identify high-consumption areas and optimize energy usage across their entire facility.
- **How it works:** 
  - Each ESP32 device is uniquely identified by its MAC address (deviceCode)
  - Central MQTT broker receives data from all devices
  - Web interface provides device selection, filtering, and comparison capabilities
  - Database stores all device data with proper device attribution

### Data Storage
- **What it does:** Persistently stores collected power consumption and environmental data from all devices indefinitely. Data integrity is prioritized, allowing for eventual consistency over immediate real-time updates during network issues.
- **Why it's important:** Enables comprehensive historical analysis and trend identification across various sensor readings and multiple devices.
- **How it works:** Flask backend receives MQTT data from multiple devices, parses the JSON (including the device's timestamp and deviceCode), and saves the individual fields to a MySQL database with proper device identification.

### Web-based Visualization
- **What it does:** Displays power consumption and environmental data, trends, and summaries through a user-friendly web interface with support for multi-device views and comparisons.
- **Why it's important:** Makes complex data easily understandable and accessible to users for comprehensive monitoring across multiple devices and locations.
- **How it works:** Vue.js frontend fetches data from the Flask API and renders interactive charts/dashboards with device filtering, comparison views, and consolidated displays.

### AI-driven ESG Report Generation (Environmental Focus, including Carbon Emissions)
- **What it does:** Analyzes power and environmental data from single devices or device groups using an LLM (Claude API) to generate ESG reports focused solely on environmental aspects (E in ESG), including calculated carbon emissions, personalized energy-saving tips and insights, utilizing recent 3 months of data. The output will follow a structured table format for key metrics and will initially be displayed on the web.
- **Why it's important:** Provides intelligent, actionable recommendations based on multi-dimensional data from multiple measurement points, specifically tailored for environmental sustainability reporting, and presents them in a standardized, easy-to-understand format, now with quantifiable carbon impact across all monitored areas.
- **How it works:** Flask backend communicates with the AI/LLM module, which queries MySQL for recent 3 months of data from selected devices or all devices. The LLM will calculate carbon emissions from power consumption using the given factor (0.478 kgCO₂/kWh) and then use Claude API for analysis to produce ESG-focused insights and reports formatted for web display and eventual PDF export.

## User Experience
