- **Rule: English Only for Rules and Tasks**
  - **Scope:** This rule applies to all Cursor rule files (`.mdc`) and Taskmaster task definitions (`tasks.json`).
  - **Requirement:** All content, including descriptions, details, titles, and comments within these files, must be written in English.

- **Rationale:**
  - **Consistency:** Ensures a consistent language across all project management and meta-level documentation.
  - **Collaboration:** Makes the project accessible to a wider range of collaborators who may not speak other languages.
  - **Tool Compatibility:** Prevents potential encoding or parsing issues with various development tools.

- **Process:**
  - When creating or modifying a Cursor rule, write all text in English.
  - When creating or updating a Taskmaster task (e.g., using `add_task`, `update_task`), ensure all prompts and descriptions are provided in English.
